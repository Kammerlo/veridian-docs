# Veridian Platform Overview

Veridian is an open-source platform designed to support the verification needs of the future.
Our approach enables scalable identity management, modular use of verifiable credentials, and strong security measures, including protection against threats such as quantum attacks.

The platform consists of user-facing applications, backend services, and high-availability agents, offering complete composability for independent development. Additionally, an out-of-the-box sandbox environment is available for end-to-end experimentation and testing.

## Components

### Wallet

The Veridian mobile wallet is a user-friendly, white-label solution for creating self-certifying identities and issuing credentials. Built on KERI, it supports unique features like multi-signature credential presentation, signing, and key rotation and recovery mechanisms.

### Infrastructure

Veridianâ€™s infrastructure includes high-availability edge and cloud agents that facilitate credential issuance and verification. These components are designed for easy deployment, requiring no specialized encryption knowledge. Witness nodes further enhance security by ensuring data integrity and tamper resistance.

### Services

For a verifiable and auditable record, Veridian enables signing of events on the blockchain, providing flexibility for interoperable credential tracking across different blockchain networks.

The Veridian sandbox offers access to our credential management tool, enabling developers to simulate credential issuance and verification in a controlled environment.
