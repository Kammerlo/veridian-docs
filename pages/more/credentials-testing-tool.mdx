# Credentials Testing Tool

The Identity Wallet team has created a tool to help development that allows you to create connections and issue credentials. This tool can be accessed by this [link](https://cred-issuance-ui.idw.cardanofoundation.org/) and can be used to try issuance features on the Identity Wallet.

## Create a connection

First thing that it’s needed to interact with the Credentials Testing Tools is to create a new connection between the Identity Wallet and it. To do this click on the “REQUEST OOBI” button.

Scan the QR code clicking in the Scan tab in the Identity Wallet. A new connection will appear in your list of connections.

## Share your Identifier

To issue credentials, the Credentials Testing Tool needs information from one of your identifiers. To provide this, go to the Identity tab in the Identity Wallet and click on the credential you want to share to view its details.

Click on the share icon located at the top right corner of the screen to access the QR code that can be used to share your identifier.

In the Issuance Credential Tool, click the “GET SCANNER” button and then “Request Camera Permissions” to activate your device’s camera and scan the identifier's QR code.

<Callout type="info">
  Your browser will prompt you for permission to access your camera; click
  “Allow” to grant access.
</Callout>

Once you have scanned the QR code, you will receive a message saying, "The wallet OOBI was resolved successfully.”

## Issue a credential

To issue a credential using the Credentials Testing Tool, click on the “ISSUE CREDENTIAL” option in the top menu.

In the “Established Connections” dropdown menu, select the identifier you provided earlier. You can identify the credential by the name you set during the onboarding process.

Next, select the type of credential you want to issue—in this case, a “RARE EVO Attendee Credential”. Enter your name in the Name field to personalise the credential, and click on the “ISSUE CREDENTIAL” button.

You will receive a notification in the Identity Wallet. Click on the “Notification” tab in the menu to access it, and then click on the notification to begin the credential receipt process.

In the new screen, click on the “Accept” button to accept the incoming credential.

Once you have received the credential, you can access it by clicking on the Credentials tab in the menu and selecting the credential to view its details.
