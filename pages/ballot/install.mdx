# Downloading and installing the Identity Wallet

The first step in this series of tutorials covers the process of installing the Identity Wallet on a device. Since the Identity Wallet is in the alpha version and not publicly accessible for download in the App Store or Google Play Store, the following steps should be followed to complete the installation.

Follow the steps according to the operating system:

- [iOS](./install#ios---testflight)
- [Android](./install#android---google-play-store)

## iOS - TestFlight

In the welcome email for the alpha program, you'll find a link for installing the app on iOS devices. Click this link to open it in a web browser.

You'll use Apple's beta app distribution service, TestFlight, to install the Identity Wallet. This service will also notify you when a new release of the Identity Wallet is available.

Click the “View in App Store” button to continue.

In the App Store, click the “Get” button to install the TestFlight app.

Once the app is installed, click the “Open” button to launch TestFlight.

Click the "Continue" button to start the onboarding process in TestFlight.

Review the Terms and Conditions of TestFlight and click "Agree" to accept them.

This is everything that needs to be done on the TestFlight app for the moment. Let’s come back to the browser.

On the page opened using the link from the welcome email, go to step 2 and click the “Start Testing” button. This will open the TestFlight app.

Read the Terms of Service and click the "Accept" button to agree. Then, click the “Install” button to install the Identity Wallet on your device.

Once the installation process is complete, click the “Open” button to launch the app. As it is likely your first time using TestFlight, you will be prompted with some tips on sharing feedback. After reading them, click the “Start Testing” button and then the “Next” button to begin the onboarding process in the Identity Wallet.

## Android - Google Play Store

In the welcome email for the alpha program, you'll find a link for installing the app on Android devices. Click the link to open it in a web browser.

Once the page opens, click the “ACCEPT INVITE” button at the bottom of the page to join the internal test program.

Once you have joined the internal test program, click the “download it on Google Play” link located under the green border box. This will redirect you to the Google Play Store App.

Click the “Install” button to install the Identity Wallet on your device.

Once the installation process is complete, click the “Open” button to start the onboarding process in the Identity Wallet.
