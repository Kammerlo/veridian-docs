# Downloading and installing the Identity Wallet

The first step in this series of tutorials covers the process of installing the Identity Wallet on a device. Since the Identity Wallet is in the alpha version and not publicly accessible for download in the App Store or Google Play Store, the following steps should be followed to complete the installation.

Follow the steps according to the operating system:

- [iOS](./install#ios---testflight)
- [Android](./install#android---google-play-store)

## iOS - TestFlight

In the welcome email for the alpha program, you'll find a link for installing the app on iOS devices. Click this link to open it in a web browser.

You'll use Apple's beta app distribution service, TestFlight, to install the Identity Wallet. This service will also notify you when a new release of the Identity Wallet is available.

Click the “View in App Store” button to continue.
