# Connecting to Cardano Ballot

With the first identifier ready, the next step is to connect to the Cardano Ballot website to use the identifier for casting votes.

Access Cardano Ballot 2024 from this [link](https://voting.summit.cardano.org/). First, press the "Connect" button located in the top right corner of the window.

A new window will appear, prompting for the wallet to be connected. Select the "Connect Identity Wallet" option. A QR code will be displayed on the screen, which needs to be scanned using the Identity Wallet.

To create a new connection with Cardano Connect using the Identity Wallet, navigate to the menu tab of the app by clicking the button in the bottom right corner of the screen, then select the “Cardano connect” tile.

In this menu, to create a new Cardano Connect connection, click the "Connect with Cardano" button or the plus icon in the top right corner.

This action will open the phone's camera to scan the QR code from the Cardano Ballot website.

A popup screen will appear asking if a CIP-45 Connection should be established. Click "Accept" to continue with the connection setup process.

Each Cardano Connect connection requires an identifier to sign and verify information, such as votes cast in Cardano Ballot. Therefore, one of the identifiers must be selected. For this process, the identifier created in the previous chapter of this tutorial will be used. Select the identifier and click the "Confirm" button.

The Cardano Ballot webpage will update to indicate that the wallet is attempting to connect. Click "Accept" to start the connection.

Congratulations! Cardano Ballot and the Identity Wallet are now connected. The Cardano connect button will now display your connection status.
