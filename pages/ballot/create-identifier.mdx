# Create your first identifier

After completing the onboarding process, your next step is to create your first identifier. You will use this identifier to sign and verify votes in Cardano Ballot.

To create a new identifier, press the "Add an Identifier" button or the plus button in the top right corner of the app.

Choose a name that helps you remember the identifier’s purpose. For voting on Cardano Ballot, select "Individual" as the identifier type. Voting using group identifiers is not yet supported for Cardano Ballot.

</Callout>

After generating the identifier, it will appear in the deck of identifiers in the Identifiers tab of the app. Click on the card to access all the details of the identifier.

  Due to on-going GDPR considerations users participating in the Alpha program
  will not be able to leverage the on-chain verification service that is
  available to stake address-based voters. In order to provide on-chain
  verification, Alpha user’s Key Event Logs will need to be written on-chain and
  the format and process for Keri on Cardano are still under development.
