# Create your first identifier

After completing the onboarding process, your next step is to create the first KERI Autonomic Identifier (AID). You will use this identifier to sign and verify votes in Cardano Ballot.

To create a new identifier, press the "Add an Identifier" button or the plus button in the top right corner of the application. This action will take you to the "Add an Identifier" screen.

In this menu, create a new identifier by adding a name to it. Choose a name that helps you remember the identifierâ€™s purpose. For voting on the Cardano Ballot, select "Individual" as the AID type. The default AID is a transferable, non-ephemeral identifier.

<Callout type="info">
  For more information on KERI AIDs click on the information icon next to the
  AID type text.
</Callout>

Once you have entered all the details for the identifier, click the "Create Identifier" button at the bottom of the screen to create it.

After generating the identifier, it will appear in the deck of identifiers in the Identity tab of the app. Click on the card to access all the details of the identifier.
